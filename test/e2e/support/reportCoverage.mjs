//
// Each dump is already real Istanbul-format coverage (statementMap,
// branchMap, fnMap, with actual hit counts) keyed by original absolute
// source path - babel-plugin-istanbul bakes counters straight into the
// source at build time (see webpack.config.js's COVERAGE=true path), so
// there's no V8-coverage-to-Istanbul conversion or sourcemap remapping
// involved here, unlike an earlier version of this script that went
// through Playwright's page.coverage API + v8-to-istanbul. That approach
// turned out to be unreliable for a file the size of contentscript.js -
// V8 doesn't always hand back full block-level detail, and the merge
// silently produced a 0-branch, 0-function "100%" that meant nothing.
// Source instrumentation doesn't have that failure mode: every counter is
// real code that ran, or it isn't.

  //   returns "und" for every page tried in this Chromium build,
  //   regardless of how much real text the page has.
  // - the 'get_options' case: "Only used by Manifest V2 version" (its own
  //   comment) - this harness only ever builds and runs MV3.
  // - onInstalled's non-'install' reasons ('update', 'chrome_update'): only
  //   fire on a real install/update, which a harness that always loads a
  //   fresh unpacked extension never produces.
  // - commands.onCommand entirely: real OS-level keyboard shortcuts,
  //   not reachable through Playwright's page-level API (see
  //   typeAndTranslate's toolbar-icon workaround - there's no equivalent
  //   for a global keyboard shortcut).

  // - calculatePopupPosition's "align with selection start" and "pin to
  //   the very top" branches: reachable in principle, but pinning down
  //   the exact popup-width-vs-viewport arithmetic to hit only those two
  //   (out of 8 total placement branches, the other 6 of which do have
  //   real tests - see popupPositioning.test.mjs) got impractical for the
  //   marginal value.
  // - getHitWord's deepest internals (hit-between-lines, the escape_html
  //   switch for a literal <, > or & inside a hovered word, "missed the
  //   exact letter"): real, but pixel-precise DOM hit-testing edge cases
  //   inside a recursive text-narrowing algorithm - not something a
  //   fixture can reliably force without contriving the exact layout.
  // - visibilitychange's "still hidden, don't reload" branch:
  //   document.hidden never actually becomes true in this environment
  //   (see interactionEdgeCases.test.mjs's note on that).
  // - the "mouse selection was outside the selected container, fall
  //   through to point-mode getHitWord" branch: a specific mouse-vs-
  //   selection geometry case, same category as the popup positioning
  //   gaps above.
  // - speak()'s repeat-keypress guard (!e.originalEvent.repeat): browser
  //   auto-repeat isn't something Playwright's keyboard API simulates.
  // - speak()'s onended handler: would need to wait out real TTS audio
  //   playback to completion.
  // - the reverse-translate branch inside the TTS keydown handler:
  //   inherits background.js's reverse-translate gap above (same root
  //   cause, same file's chrome.tabs.detectLanguage limitation).
  // - `e.source != window` in the postMessage listener, and the
  //   `window != window.top` iframe guard: both need a genuinely
  //   different message source / an iframe fixture to hit for real,
  //   rather than exercising anything this suite's single-frame pages can.
  // - withOptionsSatisfied's and the keydown handler's `!options` guards:
  //   provably unreachable now that every test waits for
  //   waitForOptionsLoaded() before interacting - ironically, the race
  //   that guard exists for is the same one the timeout-review pass
  //   removed from this suite.
