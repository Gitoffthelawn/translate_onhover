// Replays real, previously-captured Google Translate responses instead of
// e2e tests hitting Google's servers directly - test/endpoints.test.mjs
// already covers "did Google change its response format" as a dedicated,
// scheduled canary, so there's nothing left for the e2e suite to gain by
// also calling the real API on every run, and every real call is one more
// chance at getting IP/extension-flagged for volume.
//
// A test that needs a specific real API failure mode (a 429, a malformed
// primary-API response, both APIs down) registers its own context.route()
// for that - Playwright runs the most-recently-registered matching route
// first, so those still take priority over this file's fixture replay.
